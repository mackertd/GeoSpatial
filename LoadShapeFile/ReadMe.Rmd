# Try the following at the R Console

### Examine the fileLayers variable

fileLayers

```
[1] "USA_adm1" attr(,"driver")
[1] "ESRI Shapefile" attr(,"nlayers")
[1] 1
```

The first attribute is the layer name we use to load the shape file

### Examine the fileInfo variable

fileInfo

```
Source: "/Users/mackertd/GeoSpatial/USA_adm/USA_adm1.shp", layer: "USA_adm1"
Driver: ESRI Shapefile; number of rows: 52
Feature type: wkbPolygon with 2 dimensions
Extent: (-179.1506 18.90986) - (179.7734 72.6875)
CRS: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
LDID: 0

Number of fields: 9
       name type length typeName
1      ID_0    0     10  Integer
2       ISO    4      3   String
3    NAME_0    4     75   String
4      ID_1    0     10  Integer
5    NAME_1    4     75   String
6    TYPE_1    4     50   String
7 ENGTYPE_1    4     50   String
8 NL_NAME_1    4     50   String
9 VARNAME_1    4    150   String
```

This variable provides a lot of information about the shape file to include the projection and the field names
